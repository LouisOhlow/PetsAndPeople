Pets and People

Author:

Info:
  While creating this project, i began by learning ReactJS with a tutorial by TraversyMedia: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A71aqufiNtQ&t=1845s'.
  Because of that, some code parts in the client folder might be similar to his tutorial.

You still need to install the modules required and mentioned in the package.json file.

How to start:
1. open the CMD
2. cd to the petsandpeople folder
3. to start the client and the server enter: npm run dev

now the web-app should be running on 'localhost:3000'
